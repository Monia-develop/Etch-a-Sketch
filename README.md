- Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨

This project is a browser-based sketchpad inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

The idea is simple: create a grid of square divs (16x16 by default) that the user can draw on by hovering over them with their mouse. The grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript, and Flexbox is used to layout the squares into a responsive grid.

There's also a button that allows users to generate a new grid with a custom size (up to 100 squares per side), while keeping the overall sketch area consistent.


- Features

- Dynamic grid generation using JavaScript
- Responsive layout with Flexbox
- Hover effect to simulate drawing
- Button to reset and resize the grid


- What Iâ€™m practicing

This project is part of my journey through the foundations of web development. Itâ€™s focused on reinforcing core skills like:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Flexbox layout techniques
- Basic interactivity and user input
- Styling elements dynamically with JavaScript


- Extras

As an optional challenge, Iâ€™ve also experimented with:

- Random RGB colors on hover
- Progressive darkening effect (each hover increases opacity until fully black)

This was a great exercise to combine layout and interactivity, and a fun way to get more comfortable with vanilla JavaScript and Flexbox.
